# claude-templates

These represent a series of CLAUDE-CODE prompts that can be used to influence its behaviour.

You can combine any and all of these to improve the output of CLAUDE.

### How to use

In your project:
- Create a `CLAUDE.md` file at the top level
- Figure out your desired practices, e.g. `TDD`, `DI`, `OOP` etc.
- Copy and paste the content from each file into your `CLAUDE.md` file
- Open `claude`

Note: I've found you may need to prompt claude code to obey the rules laid out in `CLAUDE.md` regularly.
