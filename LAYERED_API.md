## Layered API Architecture Pattern

**Core Principle**: Design APIs as a stack of abstraction layers, where each layer builds upon the capabilities of the layer below while providing increasingly domain-specific and user-friendly interfaces.

### Layer Characteristics:

**1. Foundation Layer (Transport/Communication)**
- Provides basic communication and data exchange primitives
- Handles low-level protocol and connection details
- Offers direct access to raw operations and data flows
- Manages fundamental system resources

**2. Component Layer (Entity/Resource Management)**
- Wraps foundation layer with entity-specific logic
- Maps high-level component concepts to low-level operations
- Manages individual component state, lifecycle, and validation
- Provides component-specific interfaces and capabilities

**3. Feature Layer (Capability/Service)**
- Combines components to deliver cohesive functionality
- Provides domain-meaningful operations and workflows
- Abstracts away individual component orchestration
- Focuses on user-facing capabilities and business logic

**4. Application Layer (Experience/Orchestration)**
- Coordinates multiple features into complete user experiences
- Offers high-level, task-oriented interfaces
- Handles complex cross-feature interactions and state management
- Provides unified, user-centric abstractions

### Key Benefits:

- **Progressive Abstraction**: Users can operate at their preferred level of detail
- **Flexibility**: Direct access to lower layers when needed for specialized use cases
- **Maintainability**: Changes in lower layers don't necessarily impact higher-level users
- **Composability**: Higher layers can be built by combining lower-layer primitives
- **Domain Alignment**: Each layer speaks the language appropriate to its abstraction level

### Design Guidelines:

1. **Dependency Direction**: Each layer only depends on layers below it
2. **Abstraction Leakage**: Higher layers shouldn't expose lower-layer implementation details
3. **Escape Hatches**: Provide access to lower layers when higher-level abstractions are insufficient
4. **Consistent Patterns**: Similar operations at the same layer should follow similar interfaces

### Examples Across Domains:

**Electronics/Hardware:**
- Foundation: I2C bus (read/write registers)
- Component: MCP23700 chip (pin operations)
- Feature: Seven-segment display (segment control)
- Application: Multi-digit display (text/number rendering)

**iOS Application:**
- Foundation: URLSession (HTTP requests/responses)
- Component: APIClient (endpoint-specific calls)
- Feature: UserService (login, profile management)
- Application: AuthenticationFlow (complete sign-in experience)

**Database Systems:**
- Foundation: Database schema (tables, columns, constraints)
- Component: SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE operations)
- Feature: ORM mapping (SQL results to domain objects)
- Application: Repository pattern (business domain operations)

**Web Development:**
- Foundation: DOM APIs (element manipulation)
- Component: UI components (buttons, inputs)
- Feature: Form handler (validation, submission)
- Application: User registration workflow (multi-step process)
